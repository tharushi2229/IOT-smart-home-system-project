# Smart Home System (Arduino)

This project is an **Arduino-based Smart Home System** that integrates multiple sensors to enhance safety and automation. It detects motion, light intensity, gas leaks, and object distance, while responding with LEDs, a buzzer, and a servo motor.

## üöÄ Features

* **Ultrasonic Sensor** (HC-SR04): Detects objects within a range and triggers an LED.
* **PIR Motion Sensor**: Detects human movement and activates an LED.
* **Gas Sensor (MQ-series)**:

  * Detects presence of harmful gases.
  * Activates warning LED and buzzer.
  * Controls a **servo motor** (e.g., to close a gas valve).
* **LDR Sensor**: Measures light intensity and switches an LED accordingly.
* **Piezo Buzzer**: Alerts in case of gas leakage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures distance. If an object is close, the ultrasonic LED turns ON.
2. **PIR Sensor**: Detects motion and turns ON the PIR LED.
3. **Gas Sensor**: If gas levels exceed a threshold:

   * Warning LED and buzzer activate.
   * Servo motor rotates (e.g., to shut off a gas valve).
4. **LDR Sensor**: Detects ambient light and controls LED brightness.
